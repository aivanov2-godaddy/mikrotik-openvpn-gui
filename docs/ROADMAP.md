# Public roadmap

The project is developed public-first: generic features are designed, tested,
and released here before an operator optionally evaluates them in a private
canary. This source repository never receives router credentials, live user
data, deployment runners, or production network details.

## v1.1 — Installation Wizard ✅

An offline, review-only installer that validates non-secret answers and renders
a RouterOS `.rsc` plan. It keeps Container package installation, device-mode
physical confirmation, TLS, storage checks, firewall/DNS work, and applying
commands explicitly manual.

## v1.2 — Policy templates and groups ✅

Protected `standard`, `contractor`, and `administrator` templates, plus custom
templates. Selected users receive a preview before an explicit, checkpointed
apply; later direct edits are retained as visible per-user overrides.

## v1.3 — Health and actionable alerts (implemented)

The dashboard now brings RouterOS REST reachability, dashboard storage,
OpenVPN service, profile-issuance prerequisites, certificate state, and router
capacity into one read-only view. Each result explains its impact and a safe
next step; it never changes RouterOS automatically. Per-user quota and schedule
alerts remain visible in the normal dashboard alert list.

## v1.4 — Reports and audit (implemented)

The audit page now supports readable date-range exports in redacted CSV and
JSON formats, in-page filtering, and bounded automatic retention. Exported
records contain action metadata only; passwords, private keys, profiles, and
RouterOS secrets are excluded.

## v1.5 — Backup and restore safety (implemented)

The setup planner can download a local metadata-only archive and verify an
existing archive's structure, format, and SHA-256 checksum entirely in memory.
Compatibility results are recorded in Change History; restore remains an
explicit review-only operation and is never applied automatically. Backups
remain local to the operator.

## v1.6 — Administrator guardrails (implemented)

Clear capability matrix, explicit destructive-action confirmations, and richer
audit rationale without a second administrator-password database.

## v1.7 — Opt-in integrations (implemented)

The dashboard supports provider-neutral HTTPS webhooks for sanitized audit
events, signed with HMAC-SHA256 and delivered asynchronously through a bounded
queue. `/healthz` and `/readyz` provide lightweight monitoring probes. Both
integrations are disabled unless explicitly configured; provider-specific
services remain optional adapters rather than hard dependencies.

## v1.9 — Review-first OpenVPN foundations (implemented)

The installer retains its short path for routers that already run OpenVPN. An
opt-in advanced planner is being added for a supported router with no existing
OpenVPN server: it validates that boundary and creates a copyable, non-secret
plan for the CA, server certificate, address pool, PPP profile, OpenVPN server,
and a disabled firewall rule. The plan includes a RouterOS checkpoint command
and requires the operator to review firewall placement, NAT, and enabling the
server in a maintenance window. It never changes RouterOS automatically. The
release also includes a full first-install playbook and a redacted real-router
canary acceptance procedure, so a maintainer can verify the public image before
it is promoted by their router-local deployment controller.

## v2.0 — Device posture checks (phase 1) ✅

The Device Profiles view evaluates each managed profile against the RouterOS
certificate inventory already read by the dashboard. A profile is marked
**Approved** only when its certificate is present, non-revoked, and issued by
the configured current CA; missing, revoked, or legacy-CA identities are
marked **Needs review** with an explanatory reason. This is deliberately
read-only: it does not rotate the CA, alter certificates, or change RouterOS.
Explicit device revocation remains the separate, confirmed action.

## v2.0 — Production observability (implemented)

Service Health now includes a local deployment history, a compact health
timeline, and rollback visibility for immutable releases. The authenticated
`/api/observability` endpoint and the normal live-status payload expose the same
metadata to the UI. Observations stay on the router-hosted database, are
retention-pruned, and never include CA material, credentials, profiles, or
RouterOS configuration.

## v2.1 — Mobile administrator workflows (implemented)

The same dashboard is optimized for phones and tablets. Responsive navigation,
touch-sized controls, safe-area spacing, viewport-safe dialogs, stacked action
groups, readable health cards, and bounded horizontal tables keep
administrative workflows usable in portrait and landscape without adding a
native app or changing the OpenVPN client experience. These are
presentation-only changes: APIs, RouterOS state, certificates, CA material,
and the router-hosted data boundary remain unchanged.

The follow-up polish pass adds an adaptive navigation treatment, stronger
mobile hierarchy, rounded card grouping, thumb-sized primary actions, clearer
live-session facts and graph containers, and keyboard-safe dialog surfaces.
Active navigation scrolls into view when a dashboard card opens another view;
all existing keyboard and screen-reader semantics remain intact.

Appearance preferences are available from the top bar on every dashboard view:
Standard preserves the slate WinBox baseline, Dark is tuned for low-light use,
Light provides a high-contrast daylight surface, and System follows the device
preference. The choice is browser-local and presentation-only.

## v2.2 — Administrator roles and authentication audit (implemented)

RouterOS groups map to Owner, Security operator, Administrator, Auditor, and
Read-only roles. A shared capability matrix is enforced by every API mutation
and mirrored by the UI, while the router remains the identity source and no
second dashboard-password database is introduced. Change History records
successful and failed sign-ins, role assignment, denied capabilities, and
dashboard-session revocation with safe metadata only. This release does not
modify CA material, certificates, issued profiles, RouterOS configuration, or
router-hosted VPN data.

Every roadmap item gets a focused issue, pull request, passing CI, and squash
merge. This milestone shipped in PR #137. See the live GitHub
[roadmap issue](https://github.com/aivanov2-godaddy/mikrotik-openvpn-gui/issues/4).

## v2.3 — Enterprise operations foundations (implemented)

This release starts the next enterprise-grade layer while preserving the
review-first and router-data boundaries:

- **Administrator session center:** safe session inventory with source,
  authentication method, idle/absolute expiry, and explicit revocation. The
  current session cannot revoke itself.
- **Break-glass recovery planning:** owner/security-operator users can produce
  a time-limited, reason-bound RouterOS recovery checklist. It is a plan only;
  it creates no credentials and changes no RouterOS state.
- **Signed release verification:** immutable GHCR SHA tags are checked against
  the reported revision before promotion. Mutable tags are rejected and the
  CA/data preservation gate is shown in the result.
- **Real-time telemetry:** an authenticated Server-Sent Events stream supplies
  connection snapshots, with the existing five-second polling path retained as
  a resilient fallback.
- **Profile diagnostics:** uploaded profiles are parsed in memory for endpoint,
  protocol, certificate blocks, and modern TLS safeguards; profile contents and
  private keys are never persisted or echoed.
- **Segmentation planning:** LAN/internet/full-tunnel zones and CIDRs can be
  reviewed as a deterministic plan before any future RouterOS implementation.
- **Metrics and compliance:** `/metrics` exposes secret-free Prometheus
  counters; a bounded compliance ZIP contains redacted summary, audit, and
  connection data.
- **Scoped API tokens:** short-lived, read-only bearer tokens can be issued,
  listed, and revoked by security-capable operators. Only a one-time plaintext
  token is shown; storage retains a hash and metadata only.
- **Accessible mobile/PWA foundation:** touch-safe controls, reduced-motion
  support, consistent labels, and an installable web-app manifest improve
  phone workflows without changing the OpenVPN client experience.

All controls are capability-gated and audited. No item in this foundation
release rotates or deletes CA material, certificates, profiles, RouterOS
configuration, or router-resident VPN data. This milestone shipped in PR #138;
the feature remains release-tagged separately from the published v2.0.0 image
until the next release checklist is completed.

## v2.4 - Bulk operations and saved views (implemented)

VPN Users now supports selecting up to 100 users from the current filtered
result, reviewing a server-generated preview, and applying suspend, revoke, or
dashboard-only tag actions after an exact confirmation phrase. Suspend and
revoke operations create the same router-local checkpoint used by their
single-user equivalents; retries are idempotent, and the response reports
skipped, applied, partial, and failed users individually. Change History stores
only aggregate counts and safe action metadata, never a user list, password,
certificate, profile, or RouterOS secret.

Operators can save, load, update, and delete named views containing only the
query, status, and tag filters. Saved views are stored in the router-local
SQLite metadata database and are deliberately excluded from the public image
and repository. The feature is UI/API capability-gated and does not alter the
CA, certificate issuance, profile format, or existing `/data` mount.

## v2.5 — Binary live telemetry (deployed)

The dashboard now uses a read-only RouterOS Binary API-SSL
transport with a Socket.IO browser gateway. The first slice validates the
protocol framing and documents the migration and full-revert procedure. The
second slice adds a disabled-by-default, in-memory broker that normalizes
records, reconciles snapshots, emits versioned session transitions, and
redacts every event through an explicit allow-list. The third slice adds a
transport-neutral gateway contract that authorizes the existing RouterOS
session capability, bounds replay, and recovers stale cursors with a snapshot.
The fourth slice adds a disabled-by-default supervisor that owns only the
read-only active-session listen stream, reconnects with bounded backoff, and
publishes redacted health metrics. The fifth slice adds a compatible optional
Socket.IO adapter and capability discovery; the sixth adds a frontend
selection hook with SSE fallback and a consecutive-sample canary comparator.
The public runtime uses the authenticated Socket.IO path with SSE and REST
fallback. RouterOS REST remains the mutation path; OpenVPN CA material,
certificates, profiles, users, RouterOS configuration, and router-local data
remain outside the feature boundary. The deployed router image is healthy and
has passed the immutable-image rollout checks. The first controlled acceptance
window verified container health, REST fallback during an API-SSL interruption,
and automatic Binary API recovery. A connected-client window then verified
live connect/disconnect rendering, snapshot recovery, changing traffic
samples, and two simultaneous dashboard clients. The latest immutable image
also corrects live-rate spikes by using the full five-second sample cadence.
The controlled acceptance report records passing event-age, counter-reset,
parity, event-order, reconnect, security, and fallback evidence. The acceptance
evaluator requires explicit evidence attestations rather than allowing an
incomplete window to pass. The native ASGI/Uvicorn WebSocket runtime is
implemented behind
``SOCKETIO_ENGINE=asgi``; the dependency-free polling bridge remains the
immediate rollback mode.

## v2.6 — Durable integration delivery (implemented)

SQLite WAL mode, busy timeouts, bounded autocheckpoints, and online atomic
database backups protect router-local state. Sanitized audit events are written
to a transactionally consistent SQLite outbox and delivered at least once with
timestamped HMAC signatures, event IDs, retries, backoff, and circuit breaking.
Redis Streams is an explicit optional build/runtime path for multi-consumer
fan-out; it is not required by the single-container deployment. No GetStream
SDK or provider-specific credentials are included in the public image; a future
GetStream adapter must remain behind the same redaction, idempotency, and local
REST/SSE fallback boundary.

## Next release — Integration and rollout confidence

- Expose authenticated, payload-free metrics for Redis publishes, retries,
  SQLite outbox backlog and age, and last successful delivery.
- Test transient Redis loss/recovery, duplicate event-ID behavior, and an
  isolated SQLite backup restore rehearsal.
- Validate redacted release evidence for canary then production, requiring the
  same immutable image and digest, health/readiness, telemetry freshness and
  latency targets, Redis publish verification, REST fallback, and reconnect/
  snapshot recovery. The v2 evidence gate additionally requires a 30-minute
  sampled window, zero recorded delivery/health/event-integrity failures,
  resource peaks, and a canary rollback drill before production protection is
  considered verified.
- Keep the validator read-only: it reports evidence and never promotes an
  image or changes RouterOS policy, users, certificates, or data.

### Execution status — 2026-10-03

The issues below remain open until their full acceptance criteria are met; these
are verified partial milestones, not issue completions:

| Issue | Merged evidence | Still required |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [#192](https://github.com/aivanov2-godaddy/mikrotik-openvpn-gui/issues/192) | CI checks focus visibility, reduced motion, forced colors, and responsive CSS (#220); rendered Chromium screenshot baselines and serious/critical axe regression checks cover Dashboard, VPN Users, and Connections at desktop/tablet/mobile sizes; forced-colors rendering now verifies keyboard focus, navigation, and primary action visibility at all three viewports. | Human task validation and remediation of the explicitly baselined existing accessibility findings. The baseline is regression protection, not an accessibility-conformance claim. |
| [#194](https://github.com/aivanov2-godaddy/mikrotik-openvpn-gui/issues/194) | Expiry-aware certificate inventory and carefully scoped posture language (#231); managed per-device revocation now uses RouterOS `issued-revoke`, confirms the exact certificate's revoked timestamp by read-back before changing local state, and reports mismatch/unknown safely (#254). | Staged renewal/re-download and hardware proof of CRL enforcement, active-session handling, and rejection after reconnect; #254 does not claim these live outcomes. |
| [#195](https://github.com/aivanov2-godaddy/mikrotik-openvpn-gui/issues/195) | Change History is explicitly a bounded dashboard audit view, not a complete RouterOS event timeline (#230); actionable alerts now deduplicate by action/target and cap repeated notifications while retaining every durable audit record (#274). | Privacy-safe source/freshness correlation and incident identity across dashboard, RouterOS and Redis events. |
| [#196](https://github.com/aivanov2-godaddy/mikrotik-openvpn-gui/issues/196) | Completed for the repository scope: disposable-Redis outage/restart, ambiguous-delivery and idempotent-consumer tests (#224, #233); malformed-event classification, bounded retries and dead-letter metrics (#237); 45-event outage backlog draining (#238); pending-row recovery and explicit acknowledged-data-loss durability boundary (#240). Operations docs define at-least-once delivery, event-ID deduplication, Redis persistence requirements, and Redis-optional behavior. CI uses an isolated Redis instance and secret-free aggregate metrics are tested. |
| [#197](https://github.com/aivanov2-godaddy/mikrotik-openvpn-gui/issues/197) | Isolated backup/restore and interrupted-write/disk-full tests; bounded lock-timeout recovery and WAL checkpoint behavior (#228, #234); backup restore rehearsal opens a consistent point-in-time copy without touching the live source; backup-target failure preserves the prior backup and source database while cleaning temporary files (#257). | Sustained storage/lock stress, retention/restore operations, and a canary restore rehearsal. |
| [#198](https://github.com/aivanov2-godaddy/mikrotik-openvpn-gui/issues/198) | Process-observation freshness metrics and acceptance collection (#227, #232); slow outbound-client isolation test (#235); sequence-gap event-loss detection and integer validation in acceptance evidence (#283). | Device-backed latency/freshness percentiles, reconnect/snapshot and event-integrity tests, and proxy/browser recovery soak. |
| [#199](https://github.com/aivanov2-godaddy/mikrotik-openvpn-gui/issues/199) | Read-only health/readiness/metrics evidence collector (#226, #232); 2026-10-03 RouterOS read-back confirmed both canary and production use immutable commit tag `sha-01055d4efdc041c2443f41e08235896bf6f4f754-arm64`, and both containers report healthy. The router updater log reports production already on the approved image. Publish run [37085223385](https://github.com/aivanov2-godaddy/mikrotik-openvpn-gui/actions/runs/37085223385) passed ARM64/AMD64 build, smoke, exact-digest provenance/SBOM verification; ARM64 digest `sha256:9d9dbc94712c09a7bf40106a6a92145f36b37344255da3730c6630fb5317284f`, AMD64 digest `sha256:c767d441492c17189d2d7fd478a66f1b81882f7ee194222adffc2e75b5f1aa54`. RouterOS reports the immutable tag, not the registry digest. | Full 30-minute sampled canary/production window with latency/freshness percentiles, Redis delivery, reconnect/snapshot and event-integrity evidence; registry-manifest digest comparison from the router side and a canary rollback drill. The updater's stale global lock also needs bounded recovery so an abandoned run cannot block future releases. |
| [#200](https://github.com/aivanov2-godaddy/mikrotik-openvpn-gui/issues/200) | Stream-session revalidation tests and scoped ASVS evidence map (#218, #229); SSE now revalidates its authenticated RouterOS session and `sessions.read` capability before each telemetry write without extending idle lifetime; curated sensitive-route matrix denies anonymous reads/writes, missing-CSRF writes, and read-only access to audit/token/mutation capabilities with no RouterOS mutations; Engine.IO same-origin validation remains enabled and is regression-guarded (#287). | Complete maintained route-to-capability inventory, independent assessment, deployed proxy/browser checks, and live-router session lifecycle evidence. |
| [#201](https://github.com/aivanov2-godaddy/mikrotik-openvpn-gui/issues/201) | Redacted read-only account/group/service diagnostics (#222); unknown or incomplete RouterOS group policy tokens now force an explicit unknown permission posture rather than a false complete result (#246); IPv4/IPv6 allowlist and catch-all exposure regression coverage (#273); documentation now explains RouterOS management exposure, role-vs-platform permissions, and why no unvalidated “minimum group” recipe is published. | Effective source/network-boundary verification against supported RouterOS versions and a tested least-privilege mapping; firewall enforcement remains unknown until independently checked. |
| [#202](https://github.com/aivanov2-godaddy/mikrotik-openvpn-gui/issues/202) | Policy-template apply revalidates a session-bound preview receipt and current RouterOS state (#223); session termination reads back RouterOS state and reports verified, failed, or unknown outcomes; policy-template application now performs per-user RouterOS profile read-back and preserves local metadata only after verification (#250); user deletion now verifies managed certificate revocation before account deletion and verifies account absence before clearing local metadata, reconciling lost responses and reporting unknown/partial outcomes (#261); single-user suspend/restore verifies the RouterOS `disabled` state before clearing local enforcement, reconciles lost PATCH responses, and distinguishes mismatch from unavailable read-back (#264); single-user edits now verify RouterOS comment/disabled/profile values before committing local metadata, reconcile response loss when those fields match, report password verification as partial/unknown because RouterOS does not expose stored secrets, and require a reason-bound, session-bound, review-first receipt that rejects stale/tampered/cross-session edits (#265, #272); bulk suspend and certificate revocation use RouterOS read-back and update results in place without reloading or interrupting live telemetry; individual device revocation now requires a fresh session-bound review of exact target, reason, and RouterOS certificate state, and states active-session impact accurately (#279); profile issuance now attempts exact-certificate revocation and verifies router/local state if local device metadata cannot be recorded. | Apply/verify/recovery consistency across remaining device, certificate, and profile mutations; review and recovery guidance for partial outcomes. |
| [#203](https://github.com/aivanov2-godaddy/mikrotik-openvpn-gui/issues/203) | Immutable image tags, SPDX SBOM and provenance generation (#221); publication now verifies each detached attestation against the exact image digest, expected signer workflow, and source commit, with verification guidance and trust boundaries documented (#249). | RouterOS hardware compatibility and resource baselines remain unverified. |
| [#204](https://github.com/aivanov2-godaddy/mikrotik-openvpn-gui/issues/204) | Completed: authenticated, bounded, allowlisted diagnostic bundle with no RouterOS calls (#225); static, redacted RouterOS error guidance (#247); keyboard-accessible preview-before-download disclosure with explicit contents/exclusions and unchanged authenticated download (#256). Tests verify privacy exclusions, bounded export, no RouterOS dependency, and rendered desktop/tablet/mobile download behavior. |

The `routeros-stable` manifest was refreshed by publication run
[37085223385](https://github.com/aivanov2-godaddy/mikrotik-openvpn-gui/actions/runs/37085223385)
for runtime commit `01055d4efdc041c2443f41e08235896bf6f4f754`. Its ARM64 image
digest is `sha256:9d9dbc94712c09a7bf40106a6a92145f36b37344255da3730c6630fb5317284f`
and AMD64 digest is
`sha256:c767d441492c17189d2d7fd478a66f1b81882f7ee194222adffc2e75b5f1aa54`.
Both architecture jobs passed exact-digest provenance/SBOM verification and
runtime smoke tests. On 2026-10-03, RouterOS read-back showed both canary and
production using the immutable ARM64 tag for `01055d4`, with both containers
healthy; the router updater also logged production already on the approved
image. This verifies the deployed revision tag, not the local image's content
digest. The full 30-minute acceptance window and rollback rehearsal remain
pending, and public readiness remains gated behind Cloudflare Access.

Each issue is delivered as a focused PR with CI and acceptance evidence. Dependency order may pull security or reliability work forward when required to make a feature safe. Core live telemetry, REST/SSE fallback, RouterOS as source of truth, redaction, and review-first destructive actions remain product invariants.
