# Public roadmap

The goal is a polished, reliable, and secure self-hosted OpenVPN management GUI
for MikroTik RouterOS. The product is single-project/single-router; **multi-
tenant architecture is explicitly out of scope**.

This public roadmap tracks merged product work and a redacted summary of
remaining acceptance gates. It contains no router addresses or names,
user/session data, private origins, credentials, or raw operational logs.
Detailed operational records remain operator-controlled.

## Current project snapshot

Formal release **v2.7.0** remains the latest numbered release. PR #791
(`0002ce431fd8be0a66801725fbfb371f01ce7567`) is the latest merged mainline
commit. Its main CI and ARM64 image publication, smoke test, provenance and
SBOM verification, and stable-manifest publication passed; the immutable image
digest is recorded in [`RELEASES.md`](RELEASES.md). PR #791 adds step-level
diagnostics to the example RouterOS updater and its tests. The example script
is not included in the container image, and this publication did not stage or
run the updater on RouterOS.

The latest documented canary read-back remains PR #776; no newer
candidate-to-router mapping or passing candidate-bound 30-minute observation
is recorded. Earlier qualitative observations of live changes without refresh
are not measured latency or freshness acceptance. Two additional bounded,
read-only source reviews against PR #791's commit found no confirmed authorization
bypass in the reviewed paths. They identified a 15-second role-revalidation
cache bound and an ASVS V4.4.2 Origin-absent coverage ambiguity; the assurance
matrix now marks that control PARTIAL. These are source-review findings, not
deployed measurements or production sign-off. Candidate-specific live
acceptance, physical-host credential-memory/log review, and the named owner
risk decision remain open. No production promotion is claimed here.

The next formal release remains gated on candidate-specific canary acceptance
and the security review below. Do not create or publish v2.8.0 until the gates
pass.

| Closed in GitHub — implementation; device/certificate acceptance remains | [#194](https://github.com/aivanov2-godaddy/mikrotik-openvpn-gui/issues/194) | PR #676 adds explicit active-session termination before deleting a VPN user, with mocked ordering/failure tests. PR #702 adds a collapsed, read-only CRL configuration observation to Device Profiles without restoring the removed overview alert. PR #705 hardens cleanup of temporary RouterOS profile-export artifacts. PR #707 gates retirement on testing the replacement identity; PR #718 adds fail-closed checkpoint-failure coverage; PR #722 rejects stale, malformed, missing-expiry, and wrong-CA CRL snapshots. PR #730 requires both the stored RouterOS certificate ID and normalized fingerprint to match for a read-only inventory match. PR #737 adds a candidate-bound, operator-attested certificate-lifecycle evidence gate; its merge does not itself prove a successful live lifecycle test. The GitHub issue is closed, but candidate/device-backed CRL freshness, staged renewal and retirement, fresh-connect rejection, active-session behavior, read-back, and canary rollback evidence remain release gates tracked by #205. Profile recovery issues a new identity rather than re-downloading a retained private key. |
| Complete — acceptance tooling; live gates remain | [#199](https://github.com/aivanov2-godaddy/mikrotik-openvpn-gui/issues/199) | Closed by PR #709. The bounded read-only collector and SQLite restore verifier are implemented. Candidate-matched live soak, deployment, and rollback evidence remain release gates tracked by #205 (device/certificate acceptance) and #200 (security assurance); closing this implementation issue does not claim device acceptance. |
| Open — security assurance | [#200](https://github.com/aivanov2-godaddy/mikrotik-openvpn-gui/issues/200) | PR #791 is merged and its published ARM64 artifact is recorded in RELEASES.md; its updater example is not included in the container and was not staged on RouterOS. Two additional bounded, read-only source reviews against `0002ce4` found no confirmed authorization bypass in their reviewed paths. They identified the 15-second role-revalidation cache bound and an Origin-absent test/assurance gap; V4.4.2 is now PARTIAL. A fake-clock runtime test covers the cache deadline, but live-stream integration tests force stale state rather than naturally crossing it. These reviews are not a full requirement-by-requirement ASVS assessment, penetration test, or deployment sign-off. Still required: candidate-matched authenticated live-session, revocation/reconnect, freshness, and soak evidence; candidate-bound readiness/resource data; event/counter integrity, Binary API/REST parity, deployed Redis/SQLite recovery, and rollback; physical RouterOS permission and credential-memory/log/dump review; the named owner risk decision; and a complete independent scoped ASVS review. See SECURITY_ASSURANCE.md and LIVE_TELEMETRY_ACCEPTANCE_REPORT.md. |
| Open — tracking epic | [#205](https://github.com/aivanov2-godaddy/mikrotik-openvpn-gui/issues/205) | Close only after remaining device/certificate acceptance (tracked here despite #194's GitHub closure), #200 security review, and candidate-specific live acceptance gates pass; include the #199 collector/restore evidence in the candidate report. |

PR #776 added a regression-tested logout ordering fix: revoke the session
before writing the audit event. PR #778 added redacted origin-rejection
diagnostics and Engine.IO handshake SID binding. PR #791 added precise
step-level failure markers to the example RouterOS updater; its image was
published and attested, but the example script is not packaged in the
container. The publication did not stage or run the updater on RouterOS.
Neither merge closes the remaining deployed-security and device-acceptance
gates in #200 and #205.

The latest documented canary read-back remains PR #776, and it did not
establish a candidate-bound 30-minute acceptance window. No newer
candidate-to-router mapping or formal production promotion is claimed. Live
telemetry, recovery, deployed-security, and rollback gates remain open. See the
[candidate report](LIVE_TELEMETRY_ACCEPTANCE_REPORT.md).

PR #730's identity guard, PR #740's session-polling hardening, PR #741's
RouterOS error redaction, PR #745's preservation of sessions when initial
interface counters are incomplete, PR #751's session-expiry/WAL-startup
hardening, PR #754's duplicate-Origin rejection, and PR #755's session-bound
live telemetry revocation are included in the latest published candidate.
PR #737 adds a candidate-bound acceptance evidence gate. These merges and their
publication do not prove the pending device-backed live acceptance criteria.

## Acceptance principles

- RouterOS remains the source of truth; live dashboard updates must not require
  a page refresh or silently pause streaming.
- Canary evidence must match one immutable candidate and an explicit
  observation window. Missing or stale measurements fail closed.
- Promotion is gated on measured session-event latency, traffic freshness,
  reconnect and snapshot recovery, event/counter integrity, Redis delivery,
  resource impact, persistence/restore, rollback, and security checks.
- Production is not changed as part of public CI. High-impact router changes
  require an explicit, reviewed maintenance procedure.
- Credentials, private keys, client profiles, router exports, hostnames,
  addresses, user/session data, deployment assignments, and live measurements
  stay out of public issues, pull requests, and repository documents.
- No multi-tenancy work is planned.
